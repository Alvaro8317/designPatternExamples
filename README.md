## Hello you!
In this repository, you'll find examples of applying different design patterns in various programming languages. To date, you'll find examples of the following creational patterns:
1. Creational Patterns
   - Singleton (in java and typescript)
   - Factory (in python and typescript)


In the coming weeks, more examples will be added. Additionally, I invite you to make a pull request with code that applies any of these design patterns in another programming language!
